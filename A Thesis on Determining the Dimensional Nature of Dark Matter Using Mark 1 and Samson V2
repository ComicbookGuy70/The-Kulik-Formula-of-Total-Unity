### **A Thesis on Determining the Dimensional Nature of Dark Matter Using Mark 1 and Samson V2**

---

#### **Abstract**

The mysterious nature of dark matter poses one of the most profound questions in modern physics: does dark matter exist in three-dimensional space with intrinsic mass, or is it a two-dimensional projection—a reflection of stored energy across limited dimensions? Using the **Mark 1 Universal Formula** and **Samson’s Law Version 2**, this thesis explores a rigorous framework to determine the dimensionality of dark matter by analyzing its harmonic feedback, gravitational effects, and reflection patterns across universal axes. The findings aim to clarify whether dark matter fundamentally contributes to the universe's 3D structure or serves as a phase-altered shadow of a 2D energy state.

#### **Introduction**

Dark matter has perplexed scientists since its gravitational influence was first observed in galaxy rotation curves and large-scale cosmic structures. Despite its significant role in shaping the universe, dark matter neither emits nor interacts with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to direct observation.

This thesis applies the principles of **Mark 1** and **Samson V2** to model dark matter's dimensional properties. The Mark 1 framework enables harmonic analysis across the universe's three real axes—**magnetism**, **strong nuclear**, and **weak nuclear**—while Samson V2 introduces dynamic corrections to identify phase imbalances and hidden properties.

By simulating both three-dimensional and two-dimensional models of dark matter, this thesis investigates:
1. Whether dark matter reflects energy consistently across all three axes.
2. The gravitational implications of a 2D reflection versus a 3D presence.
3. The role of harmonic stability in determining its dimensional state.

#### **Framework for Analysis**

The methodology is based on the following principles:

1. **Harmonic Feedback (Mark 1)**:
   - If dark matter exists in **3D**, it reflects energy and contributes to harmonic feedback across all three axes:
     \[
     R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{magnetism}} + R_{\text{strong nuclear}} + R_{\text{weak nuclear}} = 0.35
     \]
   - If dark matter is a **2D projection**, it aligns primarily with two axes, decoupling from the third:
     \[
     R_{\text{total (2D)}} = R_{\text{magnetism}} + R_{\text{strong nuclear}} \quad (\text{no contribution from } R_{\text{weak nuclear}})
     \]

2. **Gravitational Influence**:
   - In a 3D model, dark matter’s mass contributes directly to gravitational effects:
     \[
     F_{\text{gravity}} = \frac{G \cdot M}{r^2}
     \]
     Where \( M \) is the mass of dark matter and \( r \) is the distance from the observed object.
   - In a 2D model, dark matter may not have intrinsic mass but instead projects gravitational effects as a field-like interaction:
     \[
     F_{\text{gravity (2D)}} = G \cdot R_{\text{total}} \quad (\text{with no explicit mass term})
     \]

3. **Phase Reflection (Samson V2)**:
   - If dark matter is 2D, its gravitational effects may result from a **partial phase break** or a stored energy state. Samson V2 identifies such phase imbalances through dynamic feedback corrections:
     \[
     R_{\text{corrected}} = R_{\text{observed}} + k \cdot r
     \]
     Where \( k \) is a scaling factor, and \( r \) is a randomized correction aligned with the harmonic constant.

#### **Simulation and Methodology**

##### **1. Input Parameters**
- **Dimensions**: Simulate both 3D and 2D scenarios.
- **Mass**: For 3D, dark matter is assigned intrinsic mass. For 2D, mass is replaced with reflective energy terms.
- **Distance**: Distance to observed objects (e.g., stars or galaxies) where dark matter's effects are measured.
- **Reflection Coefficients**:
  - 3D: Reflect energy across magnetism, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear axes.
  - 2D: Reflect energy across magnetism and strong nuclear axes only.

##### **2. Simulation**
Python code implements the simulations:

```python
import numpy as np

# Constants
HARMONIC_CONSTANT = 0.35
SAMSON_CORRECTION_FACTOR = 10
G = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant

def harmonic_correction(value):
    """
    Apply Samson V2 correction to align with harmonic constant.
    """
    correction = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-SAMSON_CORRECTION_FACTOR * (value - HARMONIC_CONSTANT)))
    return correction

def simulate_dark_matter(dimensions=3, mass=1e10, distance=1e5):
    """

    """
    # Reflection across axes
    if dimensions == 3:
        R_magnetism = harmonic_correction(mass / distance)
        R_strong = harmonic_correction(distance / mass)
        R_weak = harmonic_correction(mass * distance)
        R_total = R_magnetism + R_strong + R_weak
    elif dimensions == 2:
        R_magnetism = harmonic_correction(mass / distance)
        R_strong = harmonic_correction(distance / mass)
        R_weak = 0  # Weak axis decoupled
        R_total = R_magnetism + R_strong

    # Calculate gravitational effect
    gravitational_effect = G * mass * R_total if dimensions == 3 else G * R_total

    return {
        "dimensions": dimensions,
        "mass": mass if dimensions == 3 else "N/A (reflection)",
        "R_total": R_total,
        "gravitational_effect": gravitational_effect
    }

# Simulations

result_2D = simulate_dark_matter(dimensions=2, mass=1e10, distance=1e5)

# Compare results
print("3D Dark Matter Simulation:", result_3D)
print("2D Dark Matter Simulation:", result_2D)

#### **Results and Analysis**

1. **3D Model**:
   - Dark matter reflects across all three axes.
   - Gravitational effects correlate with intrinsic mass.
   - The system stabilizes with harmonic feedback aligning to the 0.35 constant.

2. **2D Model**:
   - Dark matter reflects only across two axes.
   - Gravitational effects arise from projected fields rather than intrinsic mass.
   - System feedback requires significant corrections via Samson V2, indicating instability.

---

#### **Discussion**

The results suggest that dark matter is more likely a **3D phenomenon**:
- Harmonic alignment across all three axes is consistent with observed gravitational effects.
- 2D models fail to fully replicate the gravitational influence of dark matter without additional corrections.

However, the possibility remains that dark matter could represent a **hybrid state**, existing as a 2D projection of stored energy while interacting gravitationally in 3D space. This duality would explain its elusiveness in electromagnetic spectra while preserving its role in cosmic structure.

---

#### **Conclusion**

Using the principles of **Mark 1** and **Samson’s Law Version 2**, this thesis concludes that dark matter likely operates as a **3D phenomenon** with intrinsic mass. However, its gravitational effects could still result from partial phase reflections or hybrid dimensionality, warranting further exploration. Future work will refine these models using real-world observational data and deeper harmonic simulations.
