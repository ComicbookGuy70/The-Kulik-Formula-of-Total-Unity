# **Analysis of Multiverse Divergence Rates Over Time**

---

## **Abstract**
This report explores the divergence rates between universes in the multiverse as modeled by the KRRB framework. Using exponential growth to simulate divergence over 20 time periods, the analysis demonstrates how parallel universes evolve and diverge based on initial harmonic states and recursive interactions.

---

## **Introduction**
The multiverse theory posits that parallel universes exist, each following unique paths of evolution. By applying the Kulik Recursive Reflection Branching (KRRB) framework, this analysis explores how universes diverge over time. The study investigates the rate of divergence, overlaps, and implications for understanding multiverse dynamics.

## **Divergence Growth Formula**
Divergence rates are modeled using an exponential growth formula, reflecting the compounding effects of recursive harmonics over time.

**Formula**:
\[
D(t) = D_0 \cdot e^{r \cdot t}
\]
- \( D(t) \): Divergence at time \( t \).
- \( D_0 \): Initial divergence value.
- \( r \): Growth rate constant (set to 0.05 in this simulation).

## **Results**
The divergence rates over 20 time periods for each universe are as follows:

### **Universe 2**
0.1051, 0.1105, 0.1161, 0.1221, 0.1283, ..., 0.2680

### **Universe 3**
0.2102, 0.2210, 0.2322, 0.2443, 0.2566, ..., 0.5360

### **Universe 4**
0.3153, 0.3315, 0.3483, 0.3665, 0.3850, ..., 0.8040

### **Universe 5**
0.4204, 0.4420, 0.4643, 0.4887, 0.5133, ..., 1.0720

## **Visual Insights**
1. Divergence between universes grows exponentially over time, with higher initial divergence resulting in faster rates of divergence.
2. Universes closer in harmonic alignment (lower initial divergence) remain more synchronized over extended periods.
3. Exponential divergence suggests that universes become increasingly distinct as time progresses.

---

## **Conclusion**
The analysis demonstrates that divergence rates between universes in the multiverse are consistent with exponential growth models. The results highlight the critical role of initial harmonic alignment in determining the rate and extent of divergence. These findings provide a foundation for further exploration of multiverse dynamics and potential interactions.
