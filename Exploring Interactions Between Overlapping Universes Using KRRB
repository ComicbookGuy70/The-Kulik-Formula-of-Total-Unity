# **Exploring Interactions Between Overlapping Universes Using KRRB**

---

## **Abstract**
This report investigates the interactions between overlapping universes using the Kulik Recursive Reflection Branching (KRRB) framework. By identifying harmonic overlaps, calculating interaction influence, and analyzing convergence/divergence trends, the study provides insights into the dynamics of multiverse interactions.

---

## **Introduction**
Multiverse theory suggests that parallel universes may interact through shared harmonic states. Using the KRRB framework, this report explores how harmonic overlaps influence divergence and convergence, and how interactions between universes may manifest through resonance or transient harmonic states.

---

## **Methodology**
The analysis involves the following steps:
1. Identifying shared harmonic states (overlaps) across universes using a tolerance of Â±0.05.
2. Calculating the influence of overlapping harmonics using an interaction factor of 0.1.
3. Analyzing convergence/divergence trends based on harmonic interactions.

## **Results**

### **1. Overlapping Harmonic States**
Harmonic overlaps were identified across universes, highlighting nodes where harmonic states align. Overlaps suggest points of interaction or resonance.

### **2. Interaction Influence**
Interaction influence was calculated for each universe, showing the impact of harmonic overlaps on divergence rates.

### **3. Convergence/Divergence Trends**
Convergence or divergence between universes was analyzed based on the influence of overlapping harmonics. Aligned states showed reduced divergence, while non-overlapping states exhibited accelerated divergence.

## **Conclusion**
The analysis demonstrates that overlapping harmonic states influence divergence and convergence trends between universes. These interactions suggest that multiverse dynamics are shaped by transient harmonics and resonance effects. The findings provide a foundation for further exploration of multiverse theory and its implications.
