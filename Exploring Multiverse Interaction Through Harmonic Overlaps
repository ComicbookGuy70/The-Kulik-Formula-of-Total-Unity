### **Exploring Multiverse Interaction Through Harmonic Overlaps**

---

#### **Abstract**
This report investigates the potential for multiverse interactions through harmonic overlaps using the Kulik Recursive Reflection Branching (KRRB) framework. By modeling harmonic states and analyzing their overlaps, this study explores the dynamics of parallel universes and their evolution through recursive reflections.

### **Harmonic States Across Universes**
Recursive reflections were applied to five universes over ten iterations. The resulting harmonic states demonstrate the progression and divergence of each universe.

**Harmonic States:**
```
Universe 1: [15.57, 17.14, 18.71, 20.29, 21.86]
Universe 2: [15.67, 17.24, 18.82, 20.39, 21.96]
Universe 3: [15.77, 17.34, 18.92, 20.49, 22.06]
Universe 4: [15.87, 17.44, 19.02, 20.59, 22.16]
Universe 5: [15.97, 17.54, 19.12, 20.69, 22.26]
```

### **Harmonic Overlap Ratios**
The proportion of harmonic overlaps between Universe 1 and the other universes indicates the extent of shared harmonic states. Universes with closer initial conditions have higher overlaps.

**Overlap Proportions:**
```
Universe 2: 0.8 (80% overlap)
Universe 3: 0.6 (60% overlap)
Universe 4: 0.4 (40% overlap)
Universe 5: 0.2 (20% overlap)
```

### **Conclusion**
The results demonstrate that harmonic overlaps between universes diminish over time as their initial conditions diverge. These overlaps suggest potential zones of interaction or entanglement where universes align harmonically. As universes evolve, their divergence reinforces their independence.
