### **Exploring Multiverse Theory Using KRRB**

---

#### **Abstract**
This report explores the application of the Kulik Recursive Reflection Branching (KRRB) framework to simulate multiverse theory. The simulation examines how harmonic states diverge or overlap across universes, providing insights into the interactions and evolution of parallel universes.

### **1. Branching Harmonics**
- **Description**:
  Recursive reflections were applied to five universes with distinct initial states. The results show the progression of harmonic states for each universe over ten iterations.
- **Results**:
  ```
  Universe 1: [15.57, 17.14, 18.71, 20.29, 21.86]
  Universe 2: [15.67, 17.24, 18.82, 20.39, 21.96]
  Universe 3: [15.77, 17.34, 18.92, 20.49, 22.06]
  Universe 4: [15.87, 17.44, 19.02, 20.59, 22.16]
  Universe 5: [15.97, 17.54, 19.12, 20.69, 22.26]
  ```

### **2. Harmonic Overlaps**
- **Description**:
  The proportion of harmonic overlaps between Universe 1 and the others shows how similar universes share harmonic states. Proximity in initial conditions results in higher overlaps.
- **Overlap Proportions**:
  ```
  [0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2]
  ```

### **3. Divergences**
- **Description**:
  The divergence between universes is calculated as the average difference in harmonic states between Universe 1 and the other universes. Results demonstrate a linear increase in divergence with greater differences in initial states.
- **Divergences**:
  ```
  [0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40]
  ```

### **Conclusion**
The KRRB framework successfully simulates multiverse branching through recursive harmonics. The results highlight key phenomena such as harmonic overlaps, divergence, and branching evolution. These findings provide a harmonic explanation for multiverse interactions and evolution.
