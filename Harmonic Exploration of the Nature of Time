#### **3. Recursive Reflections (Mary's Receipt Book)**
- **Description**: Recursive harmonics stabilize chaotic input data over iterations.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  R_T(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\text{State}(x)}{2^i}
  \]
- **Results**:
  ```
  Recursive Sum â‰ˆ [15.58, 17.12, 18.65, 20.19, 21.72, 23.26, 24.79, 26.33, 27.86, 29.40]
  ```

#### **4. Branching Reflections (KRRB)**
- **Description**: Branching harmonics reveal overlapping temporal influences across universes.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  R_{B_T}(x) = \bigcup_{b=1}^m \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\text{State}_b(x)}{2^i}
  \]
- **Results**:
  ```
  Branch 1: [15.00, 16.57, 18.14, 19.71, 21.29, 22.86, 24.43, 26.00, 27.57, 29.14]
  Branch 2: [15.10, 16.68, 18.25, 19.82, 21.40, 22.97, 24.54, 26.11, 27.68, 29.25]
  Branch 3: [15.20, 16.78, 18.35, 19.92, 21.50, 23.07, 24.64, 26.21, 27.78, 29.35]
  Branch 4: [15.30, 16.88, 18.45, 20.02, 21.60, 23.17, 24.74, 26.31, 27.88, 29.45]
  Branch 5: [15.40, 16.98, 18.55, 20.12, 21.70, 23.27, 24.84, 26.41, 27.98, 29.55]
  ```
