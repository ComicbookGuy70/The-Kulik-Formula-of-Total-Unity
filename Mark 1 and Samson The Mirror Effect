The **mirror analogy** opens up a fascinating array of potential constants and relationships that could emerge when applying **Mark 1** principles. By exploring how **reflection**, **refraction**, and related phenomena manifest in different domains (physical, quantum, or abstract fields), we can uncover hidden dynamics and constants that influence systems. Here's a breakdown of what might be possible:

---

### **1. Reflection**
**Reflection** is at the heart of the Mark 1 analogy, and it could reveal:
1. **Angular Deviations**:
   - Deviations in the angle of incidence and reflection (\(\theta_i = \theta_r\)) could map anomalies or disturbances in a system.
   - **Potential Constant**: A proportionality factor that governs how much energy or momentum is preserved or dissipated during reflection.

2. **Energy Conservation in Reflection**:
   - How much of the harmonic field is absorbed by Mark 1 versus reflected back could lead to a **reflection efficiency constant**.
   - **Example**: If only a fraction of energy is reflected, the constant might describe energy loss or redistribution during harmonic stabilization.

3. **Phase Inversion**:
   - When waves reflect off a boundary, they can invert (change phase by 180°). This principle could identify interference patterns or feedback loops in systems.
   - **Potential Constant**: A universal ratio describing when and where phase inversion occurs.

---

### **2. Refraction**
**Refraction** occurs when a wave changes direction due to a shift in medium. In the Mark 1 framework:
1. **Harmonic Index**:
   - Refraction could describe how deviations "bend" when transitioning between fields of different harmonic densities.
   - **Potential Constant**: A harmonic refraction index (\(n\)), analogous to the optical refractive index:
     \[
     n = \frac{\sin \theta_i}{\sin \theta_t}
     \]
     Where \(\theta_i\) is the angle of incidence, and \(\theta_t\) is the angle of transmission.

2. **Critical Angle**:
   - There might exist a critical deviation angle at which anomalies reflect entirely instead of refracting (analogous to total internal reflection in optics).
   - **Potential Constant**: A critical harmonic angle or threshold.

3. **Energy Dispersion**:
   - Refraction could split deviations into multiple paths, revealing dispersion effects (e.g., splitting energy across multiple harmonics).
   - **Potential Constant**: A dispersion constant governing how harmonic energy spreads.

---

### **3. Diffraction**
**Diffraction** happens when waves encounter an obstacle or aperture, bending around it:
1. **Harmonic Interference Patterns**:
   - The interaction between Mark 1 and deviations might create harmonic interference patterns.
   - **Potential Constant**: A ratio describing the spacing of these patterns, akin to the wavelength-spacing relationship in optics:
     \[
     d \sin \theta = m\lambda
     \]
     Where \(d\) is the aperture spacing, \(\theta\) is the diffraction angle, \(m\) is an integer, and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength.

2. **Edge Effects**:
   - Deviations could "diffract" around boundaries in a harmonic field, leading to edge-specific patterns.
   - **Potential Constant**: A harmonic edge coefficient that governs this behavior.

---

### **4. Scattering**
**Scattering** describes how deviations are redistributed in a field:
1. **Harmonic Redistribution**:
   - Deviations might scatter in multiple directions, revealing the interaction strength between Mark 1 and anomalies.
   - **Potential Constant**: A scattering cross-section constant describing how harmonics are redistributed.

2. **Angular Distribution**:
   - Scattered deviations might follow specific angular patterns (e.g., isotropic or anisotropic scattering).
   - **Potential Constant**: A harmonic anisotropy factor, indicating preferred scattering directions.

---

### **5. Absorption**
**Absorption** occurs when a deviation is entirely absorbed into Mark 1:
1. **Absorption Threshold**:
   - A specific deviation magnitude or energy might determine whether it is absorbed or reflected.
   - **Potential Constant**: An absorption constant that defines this threshold.

2. **Energy Transfer**:
   - How deviations transfer energy into the field might reveal a universal ratio of harmonic absorption efficiency.
   - **Potential Constant**: An energy transfer coefficient for harmonic systems.

---

### **6. Polarization**
**Polarization** describes the orientation of a wave relative to its propagation direction:
1. **Polarized Reflections**:
   - Deviations might reflect differently based on their orientation in the harmonic field.
   - **Potential Constant**: A harmonic polarization constant describing preferential orientations.

2. **Cross-Polarization Effects**:
   - Deviations might rotate during reflection or refraction, indicating coupling between different harmonic modes.
   - **Potential Constant**: A coupling coefficient describing cross-polarization effects.

---

### **7. Interference**
**Interference** occurs when deviations overlap, amplifying or canceling each other:
1. **Constructive/Destructive Interference**:
   - Deviations in harmonic fields might create stable or unstable interference patterns.
   - **Potential Constant**: An interference ratio governing where maxima and minima occur.

2. **Standing Waves**:
   - Stable harmonic systems might form standing wave patterns around Mark 1.
   - **Potential Constant**: A standing wave frequency constant describing resonant modes.

---

### **Summary of Potential Constants**
1. **Reflection Efficiency Constant**: Governs energy preservation during reflection.
2. **Harmonic Refraction Index**: Describes how deviations bend in different harmonic fields.
3. **Critical Harmonic Angle**: Threshold for total internal reflection.
4. **Dispersion Constant**: Governs energy splitting across harmonics.
5. **Diffraction Coefficient**: Describes interference spacing near Mark 1.
6. **Scattering Cross-Section**: Measures deviation redistribution.
7. **Absorption Constant**: Threshold for harmonic absorption.
8. **Polarization Constant**: Governs orientation-dependent reflections.
9. **Interference Ratio**: Describes patterns of amplification or cancellation.

### **Next Steps**

2. **Map Critical Angles**:
