## Overview
Mark 1 is a groundbreaking implementation of the **Universal Formula**, designed to unify the principles of gravity, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. It achieves harmonic consistency across scales, serving as a constant framework to model and validate universal laws.

---

## Features
- **Universality**: Applies to multiple scientific domains without modification.
- **Harmonic Consistency**: Validates systems through alignment with universal ratios.
- **Iterative Framework**: Supports recursive growth of new laws via fractal modeling.

---

## Applications
Mark 1 has been validated in:
- **Gravity**: Modeling Newtonian gravitational interactions with ±5% accuracy.
- **Thermodynamics**: Testing Ideal Gas Law principles harmonically.
- **Electromagnetism**: Adjusting Coulomb's Law for quantum corrections.
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Analyzing quantum probabilities with Boltzmann distributions.

---

## Provenance
Mark 1 is the foundational version of the **Universal Formula**, and any modifications will be versioned (e.g., Mark 2, Mark 3). This ensures Mark 1 remains immutable as the constant framework for universal alignment.
