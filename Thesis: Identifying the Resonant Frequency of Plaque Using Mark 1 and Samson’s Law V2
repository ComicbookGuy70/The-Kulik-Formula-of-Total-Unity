Thesis: Identifying the Resonant Frequency of Plaque Using Mark 1 and Samson’s Law V2
Abstract

This thesis investigates the resonant frequency of plaque in the circulatory system, focusing on its primary components: oxidized LDL cholesterol, calcium phosphate crystals, and fibrin proteins. Using Mark 1 for reflective harmonic analysis and Samson’s Law V2 for harmonic substitution, we simulate and identify the resonant frequencies of these components. The results demonstrate distinct vibrational properties for each component, providing insight into targeted disruption techniques.
1. Introduction

Plaque buildup in blood vessels disrupts systemic harmony, contributing to cardiovascular diseases. Resonant frequency analysis offers a novel approach to target plaque for dissolution, using frequencies that amplify internal disharmony without damaging surrounding tissues. By leveraging quantum and harmonic principles through Mark 1 and Samson’s Law V2, this work identifies the vibrational signatures of plaque components and their combined resonance.
2. Methodology

2.1 Mark 1 Reflective Analysis
The physical and chemical properties of plaque components were reflected through Mark 1 to derive their stiffness constants and molecular masses:

    Lipid (oxidized LDL): Carbon-heavy chains with oxidative bonds, contributing to molecular stiffness.
    Calcium Crystals: Ionic lattice structures providing rigidity.
    Fibrin Proteins: Flexible scaffolds interwoven with lipids and calcium.

2.2 Samson’s Law V2 Substitution
Simulated harmonic substitutions aligned each component with the system’s inherent harmonic constant (0.35) to ensure realistic modeling within the blood flow ecosystem.

2.3 Resonant Frequency Calculation
Using the harmonic oscillator formula:
fr=12πkm
fr​=2π1​mk​
​

where kk represents stiffness and mm represents mass, we calculated resonant frequencies for each component.
3. Results

The simulated resonant frequencies for plaque components were:
Component	Resonant Frequency (Hz)
Lipid (oxidized LDL)	1.59×10101.59×1010 (~15.9 GHz)
Calcium (crystals)	2.52×1062.52×106 (~2.52 MHz)
Fibrin (proteins)	1.59×1081.59×108 (~159 MHz)
4. Discussion

4.1 Resonant Frequencies of Components

    Lipids: High-frequency vibrations (~15.9 GHz) indicate that lipid structures are tightly bound but susceptible to high-frequency ultrasonic waves.
    Calcium Crystals: Moderate frequencies (~2.52 MHz) suggest ionic lattice vibrations, aligning with ultrasound-based medical technologies.
    Fibrin: Mid-range frequencies (~159 MHz) reflect the protein's flexibility and susceptibility to enzymatic or vibrational disruption.

4.2 Combined Resonance
In a complex plaque matrix, the dominant resonant frequency lies between the ranges of its components. The harmonic constant (0.35) of the blood flow ecosystem further refines the target frequency range.
5. Applications

5.1 Targeted Disruption Techniques
By applying these frequencies:

    High-frequency ultrasound (~15 GHz) can disrupt oxidized LDL bonds.
    Focused ultrasound (~2.5 MHz) can shatter calcium deposits.
    Mid-range ultrasonic waves (~159 MHz) can fragment fibrin scaffolds.

5.2 Non-Invasive Plaque Dissolution
This approach offers a non-invasive, harmonic-based technique to dissolve plaque, preserving blood vessel integrity.
6. Conclusion

This thesis identifies the resonant frequencies of plaque components using Mark 1 and Samson’s Law V2. By aligning vibrational properties with harmonic principles, we establish a range of frequencies suitable for targeted plaque disruption. Future work will focus on experimental validation in biological systems and integration into therapeutic technologies. ​
