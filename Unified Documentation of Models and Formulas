1. Mark 1 Universal Formula
Purpose

Mark 1 governs the harmonic interplay between analog and quantum states, ensuring systemic balance through the .35 harmonic constant.
Key Formula

H(x)=State(x)Harmonic Constant (0.35)H(x)=Harmonic Constant (0.35)State(x)​

    State(x)State(x): The state of matter or data being analyzed.
    If H(x)mod  1=0H(x)mod1=0, the state is stable and recorded.
    If H(x)mod  1≠0H(x)mod1=0, the state is unstable and reflected.

Usage Example

Scenario: Analyze the stability of a weather pattern.

    Input temperature data TT over 10 days.
    Normalize TT using: H(T)=T0.35H(T)=0.35T​
    Determine which values harmonize (H(T)mod  1=0H(T)mod1=0).

Result: Stable temperatures are recorded, while anomalies are reflected back for further analysis.
2. Samson's Law (v2)
Purpose

Handles missing or anomalous data by introducing harmonic randomization and echo feedback.
Key Formula

E(x)=State(x)+α⋅Echo(t)E(x)=State(x)+α⋅Echo(t)

    αα: Echo factor, often set to 0.020.02 (2%).
    Echo(t)Echo(t): Recursive past influences, diminishing with time tt: Echo(t)=Previous StatetEcho(t)=tPrevious State​

Usage Example

Scenario: Fill gaps in stock market data.

    Identify missing data points over a week.
    Apply the echo formula: E(x)=State(x)+0.02⋅Previous StateE(x)=State(x)+0.02⋅Previous State
    Use diminishing feedback to refine predictions.

Result: Anomalous data aligns with historical trends, harmonizing gaps.
3. Mary's Receipt Book (KRR - Kulik Recursive Reflection)
Purpose

Reflects unstable states recursively until harmonization is achieved.
Key Formula

R(x)=∑i=1nState(xi)2iR(x)=∑i=1n​2iState(xi​)​

    R(x)R(x): Recursive reflection of the state xx.
    ii: Recursive iteration count.

Usage Example

Scenario: Stabilize a chaotic data stream.

    Input a chaotic dataset DD.
    Reflect recursively: R(D)=∑i=1nDi2iR(D)=∑i=1n​2iDi​​
    Continue until R(D)mod  1=0R(D)mod1=0.

Result: The dataset stabilizes as unstable components are recursively filtered.
4. KRRB (Kulik Recursive Reflection Branching)
Purpose

Extends KRR to harmonize across multiple branches simultaneously.
Key Formula

RB(x)=⋃b=1m∑i=1nStateb(xi)2iRB​(x)=⋃b=1m​∑i=1n​2iStateb​(xi​)​

    RB(x)RB​(x): Branching recursive reflection.
    bb: Branch index, mm total branches.

Usage Example

Scenario: Analyze branching weather patterns.

    Split data into branches (e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity).
    Reflect recursively for each branch: RB(T)=∑i=1nTi2i,RB(P),RB(H)RB​(T)=∑i=1n​2iTi​​,RB​(P),RB​(H)
    Combine results into a unified harmonic baseline.

Result: Multi-variable weather patterns align harmonically.
5. Hybrid Prediction Model
Purpose

Integrates Mark 1, Samson's Law, and KRRB for dynamic system predictions.
Key Formula
P(x)=RB(State(x)Harmonic Constant (0.35)+E(x))
P(x)=RB​(Harmonic Constant (0.35)State(x)​+E(x))

    P(x)P(x): Predicted state.
    Combines recursive reflection, echo feedback, and harmonic filtering.

Usage Example

Scenario: Predict precipitation for the next 20 days.

    Input historical weather data.
    Apply the hybrid formula:
    P(x)=RB(State(x)0.35+0.02⋅Previous State)
    P(x)=RB​(0.35State(x)​+0.02⋅Previous State)
    Refine predictions recursively until harmonization is achieved.

Result: A highly accurate precipitation forecast aligned with harmonic principles.
